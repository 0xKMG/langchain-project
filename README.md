## Get Started with Langchain JS 
a basic node.js template to run langchain.js

## Setup
1. add OpenAI API key to the `.env` file `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR-KEY` and 

2. run the app with the following command
```
npm install && npm run dev 
```

edit the `app.ts` file to change the prompt.


`app.ts` uses langchain with OpenAI to generate a code snippet, format the response, and save the output (a complete react component) to a file.
